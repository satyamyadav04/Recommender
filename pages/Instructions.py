### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Content-Based Filtering** (Recommends based on course content)

#### âœ… a. **Course Similarity Model**
- We read the **text of the courses** you've selected.
- Then, we find **other courses with similar words, topics, and themes**.
- It's like saying: "If you liked Course A because it was about Data Security, you'll probably like Course B because it's also about similar topics."

#### âœ… b. **User Profile Model**
- We look at the **topics covered** in the courses you chose.
- Your profile is built based on **those topics**.
- Then we find courses that **match your overall interest areas**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Clustering Model** (Recommends based on people like you)
- We compare your course preferences with **thousands of other users**.
- You are placed into a group (cluster) of people who like **similar kinds of courses**.
- We then show you **popular courses from your group**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Collaborative Filtering**

#### âœ… a. **KNN Model**
- We see how other users **rated the same courses** you liked.
- If many people who liked your courses also liked another one, we suggest it.

#### âœ… b. **NMF Model**
- We find **hidden patterns** in how you rate courses.
- Then, we recommend others that match those patternsâ€”even if you havenâ€™t seen them.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
- Uses advanced AI to learn your learning "personality".
- Gives highly personalized suggestions based on your unique behavior.

---

**In short**:  
Just select a few courses you've likedâ€”and our system does the rest using smart AI methods!
